# Issue #3: Trust extension module

## Intent

Introduce a structured trust modeling extension that allows trust levels to be explicitly represented and validated within the Beast Mode ecosystem.

## Context

As the ecosystem expanded beyond basic Agent–Capability–Task modeling, a trust layer was introduced to support reasoning about reliability and confidence.

This work formalizes trust-related properties and validates them using SHACL.

## What Changed (Implementation Summary)

Implemented in commit:

`06576615c556265111c69915e5a530e173603c15`

This commit introduces:

- Trust extension ontology module
- Trust-related property semantics (e.g., `trustLevel`)
- SHACL constraints validating trust structure
- A validated example demonstrating correct usage
