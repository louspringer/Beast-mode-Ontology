# Issue #9: Bow-Tie messaging + network modules

## Intent

Document the bow-tie messaging and network module enhancements implemented in the referenced commit, ensuring clear traceability between the conceptual messaging architecture and its concrete ontology artifacts.

## Context

As Beast Mode messaging evolved, the system required a more structured representation of message flow, network semantics, and alignment with mailbox-core concepts. The referenced implementation formalizes these constructs within dedicated messaging and network modules.

## What Changed (Implementation Summary)

The referenced implementation introduces:

- Bow-tie messaging constructs for structured message flow modeling
- Network module additions aligned with messaging semantics
- Enrichment and alignment with mailbox-core concepts

This PR adds traceability documentation only and does not modify ontology logic.

## Primary Review Cues (Fast Skim)

Please review:

- `ontologies/modules/messaging/beast_messaging_core.ttl`
- `ontologies/modules/network/beast_network_core.ttl`
- `ontologies/modules/messaging/beast_a2a_shapes.ttl`
- `ontologies/modules/messaging/beast_mailbox_impl.ttl`
- `ontologies/alignments/beast_mailbox_alignment.ttl`

Focus on:

- Bow-tie messaging structure
- Network module relationships
- SHACL validation shapes related to messaging
- Mailbox-core semantic alignment
